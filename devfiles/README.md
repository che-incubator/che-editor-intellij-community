### Current directory contains Devfiles for Eclipse Che

In order to create the Workspace you can use one of the predefined Devfiles which placed in directories:

- `released`
  
  - Contains all released versions of Intellij-based IDE
  
- `latest`
  
  - Contains latest released versions on IntelliJ-based IDE
  
- `next`
  
  - Contains next versions on Intellij-based IDE
  
    > Next images push after each commit into `main` branch for each particular version of Intellij-based IDE

If you want to create the workspace with the particular version of IntelliJ IDEA Community or PyCharm Community, you can use one of the Devfile from directory `released` or `next`. This directory contains the workspace configurations based on the different version of JetBrains IDEs, that have been tested with Eclipse Che.
