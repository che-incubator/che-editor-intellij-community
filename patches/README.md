### Current directory contains patches which will be applied during the build

Patches should have the `.patch` extension and placed to the particular project directory needed to apply.

Patches apply correspondingly to their projects:

- projector-client
  - e.g. `/patches/projector-client/PRJ-413.patch`
- projector-server
  - e.g. `/patches/projector-server/PRJ-414.patch`
